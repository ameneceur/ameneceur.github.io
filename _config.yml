  I recently graduated in [Modelling Mathematics](https://www.ljll.fr/MathModel/presentation/mbio.html) at Sorbonne-Université.  I am currently considering any PhD opportunity involving interdisciplinarity, and interactions between mathematics and diverse social sciences disciplines, such as ethology, behavioral ecology, demography, population dynamics, etc.

  Throughout my academic background and my interships I have acquired many skills that range from <mark>Functional analysis</mark> to <mark>Stochastic process</mark>. I am proficient with a variety of programming languages and their usages as well.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
