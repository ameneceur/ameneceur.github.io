publisher = {The MIT Press},
abstract = {Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.}

  abstract  = "A comprehensive and cutting-edge introduction to the foundations
               and modern applications of learning theory. Research has
               exploded in the field of machine learning resulting in complex
               mathematical arguments that are hard to grasp for new comers. .
               In this accessible textbook, Francis Bach presents the
               foundations and latest advances of learning theory for graduate
               students as well as researchers who want to acquire a basic
               mathematical understanding of the most widely used machine
               learning architectures. Taking the position that learning theory
               does not exist outside of algorithms that can be run in
               practice, this book focuses on the theoretical analysis of
               learning algorithms as it relates to their practical
               performance. Bach provides the simplest formulations that can be
               derived from first principles, constructing mathematically
               rigorous results and proofs without overwhelming students.
               Provides a balanced and unified treatment of most prevalent
               machine learning methods Emphasizes practical application and
               features only commonly used algorithmic frameworks Covers modern
               topics not found in existing texts, such as overparameterized
               models and structured prediction Integrates coverage of
               statistical theory, optimization theory, and approximation
               theory Focuses on adaptivity, allowing distinctions between
               various learning techniques Hands-on experiments, illustrative
               examples, and accompanying code link theoretical guarantees to
               practical behaviors",
